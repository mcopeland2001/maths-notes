Testing latexmk - two different approaches to the repeated roots:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item{if the root is squared then the ${ A - \lambda I }$ matrix is squared and the eigenvector must have a cyclic order of 2 under the linear transformation. If the linear transformation is differentiation then a degree 1 polynomial satisfies this condition.}
		\item{in the case of a root of multiplicity 2 (strictly speaking \textit{geometric multiplicity} 2), the solution is the limit of the case of distinct roots as the eigenvalues tend to the same value. Using l'hopital's rule, this is shown to produce a degree 1 polynomial.}
	\end{itemize}

	limit of distinct roots:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{take complex distinct roots and let the imaginary part go to zero - results in ${ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin{x}}{x} = x }$.}
	\end{itemize}
