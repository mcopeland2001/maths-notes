		\subsubsection{Pre-requisites}
		Certain assumptions are required before even the definition of natural numbers. Most of these correspond to Euclid's "Common Notions" (\href{http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~dwh/books/eg00/00EG-AA/}{Cornell Uni - Euclid's Definitions, Postulates and Common Notions}). In particular, these give general notions of equivalence and substitutability of equal objects,
		\[ a = b \implies c + a = c + b. \]
		Also required are some fundamental axioms of logic often referred to as the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_thought}{Laws of Thought - Wikipedia}.

		\begin{axiom}{Commutative Law for multiplication:}\\ For all $a,b \in \N{}$ we have $a \times b = b \times a$.
		\end{axiom}
		\begin{axiom}{Associative Law for multiplication:}\\ For all $a,b,c \in \N{}$ we have $(a \times b) \times c = a \times (b \times c)$.
		\end{axiom}
		\begin{axiom}{Multiplicative Identity:}\\ There is a special element of $\N{}$, denoted by 1, which has the property that for all $n \in \N{},\; n \times 1 = n$.
		\end{axiom}
		\begin{axiom}{Additive cancellation:}\\ For all $a,b,c \in \N{}$ if $a + c = b + c \text{ then } a = b$.

		\end{axiom}
		\begin{axiom}{Definition of "less than":}\\ For all $a,b \in \N{},\; a < b$ if and only if there is some $c \in \N{} \suchthat a + c = b$.

		\end{axiom}
	
		Not formally one of Peano's axioms but also required is the following axiom:
		\begin{axiom}{Well-Ordering Principle: see \ref{sssection:well-ordering-theorem}:}\\ Every non-empty subset of $\N{}$ has a least element.

		\begin{proof}
			Assume $m$ is the least element of $\N{}$. Then, also $m < 1$. So, by \autoref{prop:less_than_mult_augment},
			\begin{align*}
			m < 1 \implies m \times m < 1 \times m = m
			\end{align*}
			But, closure of multiplication and $m \times m < m$ together contradict the assumption that $m$ is the least element of $\N{}$.\\
			Therefore $m$ cannot be less than $1$. Since we know that $1 \in \N{}$ and that the minimum element of $\N{}$, $m$, cannot be less than $1$, it follows that $1$ must be the minimum element of $\N{}$ and $m = 1$.

		\begin{proof}
			Assume for contradiction that
			\[ P(f(N)) \land [\, P(f(k) \implies P(f(k+1) \,] \tag{*} \]
			but there exists some ${ n > N \in \N{} }$ such that ${ \lnot P(f(n)) }$. Then, the set
			\[ S = \setc{n \in \N{}}{ n > N \; \land \; \lnot P(f(n)) } \]
			is non-empty. By the Well-Ordering Principle (\ref{sssection:well-ordering-theorem}), there is a least element of $S$. Let $a$ be the least element of $S$.\\
			
			Since, by \autoref{prop:mult_identity_least_element}, 1 is the least element of $\N{}$, either ${ N = 1 }$ or ${ 1 < N }$. In either case, ${ 1 < a }$. Therefore, by the definition of $<$, ${ \exists b \in \N{} }$ such that ${ 1 + b = a }$. By commutativity of addition therefore, ${ b + 1 = a }$ and, again invoking the definition of $<$, we have ${ b < a }$. Since ${ b < a }$, ${ b \centernot\in S }$ and we have ${ P(f(b)) }$. But, by (*), we have
			\[ P(f(b)) \implies P(f(b+1)) = P(f(a)). \]
			But this implies that ${ a \centernot\in S }$ which contradicts the definition of $a$.

		\bigskip
		\boxeddefinition{\textbf{(Integers)} An integer $n$ is defined as an equivalence class of a relation on the set of ordered pairs of naturals,
			\[ \rel \subset (\N{} \times \N{}) \times (\N{} \times \N{}) \]
			defined as, for ${ a,b,c,d \in \N{} }$,
			\[ (a,b) \rel (c,d) \iff a + d = c + b. \]
			
			Using $[x]$ to denote the equivalence class of $x$, addition and multiplication are defined as follows:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item ${ n_1 + n_2 = [(a,b)] + [(c,d)] = [(a+c, b+d)] }$
				\item ${ n_1 \times n_2 = [(a,b)] \times [(c,d)] = [(ac + bd, ad + bc)] }$
			\end{itemize}
		
			Ordering is defined as
			\[ [(a,b)] < [(c,d)] \iff a + d < b + c. \]

			\[ D_a = \setc{m \in \Z{}}{m \divides a}. \]
		Sometimes the term \textit{divisor} is used to refer to the positive such integers only but sometimes these are, more specifically, referred to as \textit{proper divisors}. The use of the term \textit{divisor} in the context of integer division is yet another usage of the term.

		\labeledTheorem{\textbf{(Division Theorem a.k.a. Remainder Theorem.)} Given two integers $a$ and $b$, with ${ b \neq 0 }$, there exist unique integers $q$ and $r$ such that
			\[ a = bq + r, \hspace{15pt} 0 \leq r < |b| \]
			where $|b|$ denotes the absolute value of $b$.}{division-theorem}
		\begin{proof}
			Consider first the case ${ b < 0 }$. Setting ${ b' = -b }$ and ${ q' = -q }$, the equation ${ a = bq + r }$ may be rewritten as ${ a = b'q' + r }$ and the inequality ${ 0 \leq r < \abs{b} }$ may be rewritten as ${ 0 \leq r < \abs{b'} }$. This reduces the existence for the case ${ b < 0 }$ to that of the case ${ b > 0 }$. \\
			Similarly, if ${ a < 0 }$ and ${ b > 0 }$, setting ${ a' = -a }$, ${ q' = -q - 1 }$, and ${ r' = b - r }$, the equation ${ a = bq + r }$ may be rewritten as ${ a' = bq' + r' }$, and the inequality ${ 0 \leq r < \abs{b} }$ may be rewritten as ${ 0 \leq r' < \abs{b} }$. Thus the proof of the existence is reduced to the case ${ a \geq 0 }$ and ${ b > 0 }$ --- which will be considered in the remainder of the proof.\\
			
			Let ${ \N{}_0 = \N{} \cup \{0\} }$ and let ${ Q = \setc{m \in \N{}_0}{bm \leq a} }$. Then $Q$ is non-empty because ${ 0 \in Q }$ and $Q$ is finite because
			\[ bm \leq a \; \land \; b > 0 \implies m \leq bm \leq a \]
			so $Q$ is an upper-bounded set of positive integers and, by \ref{axiom:well-ordering-principle-for-integers} therefore, has a maximum element. Let $q$ be the maximum element and let 
			\[ r = a - bq > 0. \]
			Since $q$ is the maximum element of $Q$,
			\[ b(q+1) > a \iff bq + b > a \iff b > a - bq = r. \]
			Therefore ${ a = bq + r }$ and ${ 0 \leq r < b }$.\\
			
			It remains to be shown that the integers $q$ and $r$ are unique. Suppose that $q'$ and $r'$ are also integers satisfying
			\[ a = bq' + r' = bq + r. \]
			Suppose \WLOG that ${ q \geq q' }$. Then,
			\[ 0 \leq r = a - bq \leq a - bq' = r' < b \]
			which implies that
			\[\begin{aligned}
				&& 0 &\leq r' - r < b \\
				&\iff & 0 &\leq (a - bq') - (a - bq) < b &\sidecomment{} \\
				&\iff & 0 &\leq bq - bq' < b \\
				&\iff & 0 &\leq b(q - q') < b \\
				&\iff & 0 &\leq q - q' < 1.
			\end{aligned}\]
			But $q$ and $q'$ are both positive integers so, by closure of addition of integers, ${ q - q' }$ is also an integer. Therefore
			\[ 0 \leq q - q' < 1 \implies q - q' = 0 \iff q = q' \iff r = r'. \]

		\begin{proof}
			Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with at least one of them non-zero and let
			\[ D_a \cap D_b = \setc{z \in \Z{}}{\exists m,n \in \Z{} \logicsep a = mz \; \land \; b = nz}. \]
			$D_a \cap D_b$ is non-empty because 1 is always a member. Furthermore, each ${ z \in D_a \cap D_b }$ must be such that ${ z \leq \min \{ \abs{a}, \abs{b} \} }$. Therefore, $D_a \cap D_b$ is a non-empty set of upper-bounded integers and so, by \autoref{axiom:well-ordering-principle-for-integers}, has a unique maximum --- which is the gcd.

		\labeledProposition{The greatest common divisor is always positive.}{gcd-positivity}
		\begin{proof}
			Let $a$ and $b$ be integers with at least one of them non-zero and let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ so that,
			\[ d = \max D_a \cap D_b = \max \setc{z \in \Z{}}{\exists m,n \in \Z{} \logicsep a = mz \; \land \; b = nz}. \]
			Firstly, notice that ${ 0 \centernot\in D_a \cap D_b }$ because at least one of $a$ and $b$ is non-zero. So ${ d \neq 0 }$.\\
			
			Suppose ${ d < 0 }$. Then, since $d$ is the maximum of ${ D_a \cap D_b }$, for each ${ z \in D_a \cap D_b }$ we have ${ z < 0 }$ and also, for some ${ m,n \in \Z{} }$,
			\[ a = mz \eqand b = nz. \]
			But then we also have,
			\[  a = (-m)(-z) \eqand b = (-n)(-z) \]
			which implies that, for ${ p = -m,\, q = -n \in \Z{} }$,
			\[ a = p(-z) \; \land \; b = q(-z). \]
			Therefore ${ -z \in D_a \cap D_b }$. But 
			\[ z < 0 \implies -z > 0 > d. \]
			This contradicts the definition of $d$ as the maximum of ${ D_a \cap D_b }$.\\

Then we also have,
			\[ a = md = p e d \; \land \; b = nd = q e d \]
			meaning that ${ e d }$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$. Since ${ e > 1 }$ it follows that ${ e d > d }$ which contradicts the assumption that $d$ is the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.\\

		\nl[3]
		\autoref{prop:gcd-of-a-and-b-eq-to-bcd-b-and-remainder-of-dividing-a-by-b} leads to the following algorithm for calculating the gcd of $a$ and $b$.
		\begin{algorithm}[H]
			\caption{gcd a,b}
			\begin{algorithmic}
				\REQUIRE Two integers $a$ and $b$, not both zero.
				\ENSURE The greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$.
				\STATE % empty line

				\RETURN a.

				\RETURN gcd $b$, $r$
				\ENDIF 
			\end{algorithmic}	
		\end{algorithm}
	
		\textit{Analysis of the gcd algorithm:}\\
		
		Denote the arguments $a$ and $b$ on the $i$-th iteration of the algorithm as $a_i$ and $b_i$.\\
		
		On each iteration, ${ a_i = b_{i-1} }$ and the argument $b_i$ becomes the remainder after integer division of the argument $a_{i-1}$ by $b_{i-1}$ of the previous iteration. So, for each iteration $i$, we have 
			\[ a_i = b_{i-1} \eqand 0 \leq b_i < \abs{b_{i-1}}. \]
		So the arguments $b_i$ are becoming non-negative and decreasing in absolute value and the arguments $a_i$ are taking on the previous iteration's value of $b_i$. Therefore both arguments are decreasing towards 0 but $b_i$ leads the way each time. Since this is integer arithmetic, eventually $b_i$ will become 0 while $a_i$ is not yet 0, and so the recursion will terminate.
		
		Let the arguments to the 1st iteration be ${ a_1 = a,\, b_1 = b }$. Then the 2nd iteration of the algorithm executes with ${ a_2 = b_1,\, b_2 = a_1 - b_1 q_1 }$ and the 3rd iteration, ${ a_3 = b_2,\, b_3 = a_2 - b_2 q_2 }$ and so on. If the algorithm terminates on the $n$-th iteration, then the final state is ${ a_n = b_{n-1},\, b_n = 0 }$. The result returned is
		\[\begin{aligned}
			d &= a_n = b_{n-1} \\
			&= a_{n-2} - b_{n-2} q_{n-2} \\
			&= a_{n-2} - (a_{n-3} - b_{n-3} q_{n-3}) q_{n-2} \\
			&= b_{n-3} - (a_{n-3} - b_{n-3} q_{n-3}) q_{n-2} \\
			&= (1 + q_{n-3} q_{n-2}) b_{n-3} - a_{n-3} \\
			&\vdots
		\end{aligned}\]
		we can continue unpacking the result until we get to an expression in terms of $a_1$ and $b_1$.\\

		\nl[2]
		The lowest common multiple of two numbers is formed by the multiplication of all the prime factors that occur in the two numbers where repititions of prime factors are important. That's to say, the lowest common multiple of 4 and 8 is not 2 (which is the highest common factor/greatest common divisor) but 8 because in 8, the factor 2 occurs three times (as $2^3$) and it occurs twice in 4,
		\[ lcm(4,8) = lcm(2\times2, 2\times2\times2) = 2\times2\times2. \]
		
		The general formula for the lowest common multiple may be expressed in terms of the gcd as follows
		\[ d = gcd(a, b) \implies lcm(a, b) = d \times (a/d) \times (b/d). \]

		\paragraph{Proof of existence}
		\begin{proof}
			It must be shown that every integer greater than $ 1 $ is either prime or a product of primes. First, $ 2 $ is prime. Then, by strong induction, assume this is true for all numbers greater than $ 1 $ and less than $ n $. 
			If $ n $ is prime, there is nothing more to prove. 
			Otherwise, there are integers $ a, b $ where $ n = ab $, and $ 1 < a \leq b < n $. By the induction hypothesis, $ a = p_1p_2...p_j \text{ and } b = q_1q_2...q_k $ are products of primes. But then $ n = ab = p_1p_2...p_jq_1q_2...q_k $ is a product of primes.
		\end{proof}
		\paragraph{Proof of uniqueness}
		\begin{proof}
			Suppose, to the contrary, that there is an integer that has two distinct prime factorizations. Let $ n $ be the least such integer and write $ n = p_1 p_2 ... p_j = q_1 q_2 ... q_k $, where each $ p_i \text{ and } q_i $ is prime. (Note that $ j $ and $ k $ are both at least $ 2 $.) We see that $ p_1 \text{ divides } q_1 q_2 ... q_k\text{ , so } p_1\text{  divides some } q_i $ by Euclid's lemma. Without loss of generality, say that $ p_1 \text{ divides } q_1 $. Since $ p_1 $ and $ q_1 $ are both prime, it follows that $ p_1 = q_1 $. Returning to our factorizations of $ n $, we may cancel these two terms to conclude that $ p_2 ... p_j = q_2 ... q_k $. We now have two distinct prime factorizations of some integer strictly smaller than $ n $, which contradicts the minimality of $ n $.

		\labeledProposition{For any integer $m$, $\sqrt{m}$ is rational iff $m$ is a square, i.e. $m=a^2$ for some integer $a$.}{rationality_of_sqrt_integers}
		To begin with we show the easier direction of implication: $(m = a^2) \implies$ ($\sqrt{m}$ is rational).
		\begin{proof}
		Assume $m,a,b \in \Z{}$.
		\begin{align*}
		m &= a^2 \\
		\iff \sqrt{m} &= \abs{a} \\
		&= a/b \text{ for } b = 1 \text{ or } -1. \qedhere
		\end{align*}
		\end{proof}
		Now the other (harder) direction, ($\sqrt{m}$ is rational) $\implies (m = a^2)$.
		\begin{proof}
		Assume $m,a,b \in \Z{}$. ($\sqrt{m}$ is rational) can be formalized as:
		\[ \exists\,m,a,b \in \Z{} \cdot (\sqrt{m} = \frac{a}{b}) \; \wedge \; \text{($a$ and $b$ are coprime)} \]
		\begin{align*}
		\sqrt{m} &= \frac{a}{b} \\[8pt]
		\implies m &= \frac{a^2}{b^2} \\[8pt]
		\iff mb^2 &= a^2 \\ 
		\end{align*}
		But $a$ and $b$ are coprime so they don't share any prime factors. This means that $a^2$ and $b^2$ also don't share any prime factors. So, if $\abs{b} > 1$, the prime factorization of $mb^2$ is necessarily different from that of $a^2$ meaning that $mb^2 \neq a^2$ contradicting the hypothesis of coprimality.
		On the other hand, if $\abs{b} = 1$, then $b$ has no prime factors (its prime factorization is empty) and so $mb^2$ has the same prime factorization as $m$ which may be equal to that of $a^2$ in the case that $m = a^2$.
		\end{proof}

		\labeledProposition{For all nonnegative integers $a > b$ the difference of squares $a^2 - b^2$ does not give a remainder of 2 when divided by 4.}{a_squared_minus_b_squared}
		Beginner's attempt - try proof by contradiction:
		\begin{align*}
		a^2 - b^2 &= 4n + 2 \\
		2k &= 4n + 2 &\sidecomment{by $a^2 - b^2$ even}\\
		k &= 2n + 1 \implies \text{ $k$ is some odd number.}
		\end{align*}
		So, proof by contradiction is our first instinct but doesn't seem to get us anywhere.
		Instead, proceed by cases:
		\paragraph{Case $a, b$ are even:}
		\begin{align*}
		\exists\,k,l \in \Z\; \cdot \;a &= 2k, b = 2l \\
		\implies a^2 - b^2 &= 4k^2 - 4l^2 \\
		&= 4\left(k^2 - l^2\right) \\
		&= 4m\; \text{ where } \;m \in \Z\;  \\
		\end{align*}
		So $4$ divides $a^2 - b^2$ with $0$ remainder.
		\paragraph{Case $a, b$ are odd:}
		\begin{align*}
		\exists\,k,l \in \Z\; \cdot \;a &= 2k+1, b = 2l+1 \\
		\implies a^2 - b^2 &= \left(4k^2 + 4k + 1\right) - \left(4l^2 + 4l + 1\right) \\
		&= 4\left(k^2 + k - l^2 - l\right) \\
		&= 4m\; \text{ where } \;m \in \Z\;  \\
		\end{align*}
		So, again, $4$ divides $a^2 - b^2$ with $0$ remainder.
		\paragraph{Case $a$ even, $b$ odd:}
		\begin{align*}
		\exists\,k,l \in \Z\; \cdot \;a &= 2k, b = 2l+1 \\
		\implies a^2 - b^2 &= 4k^2 - \left(4l^2 + 4l + 1\right) \\
		&= 4\left(k^2 - l^2 - l\right) - 1 \\
		&= 4m + 3\; \text{ where } \;m=k^2 - l^2 - l - 1 \in \Z\;  \\
		\end{align*}
		So, here, $4$ divides $a^2 - b^2$ with $3$ remainder. So the proposition is proven as we have proven all the possible cases.\\

				\item{For ${ z = a + ib }$ we have ${ a,b \in \R{} }$ so we can use the properties of the real numbers to deduce,
					\[ a = b = 0 \implies a^2 + b^2 = 0 \implies \modulus{z} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 0. \]
					\[ a,b \neq 0 \implies a^2 + b^2 > 0 \implies \modulus{z} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} > 0.  \]
				}
				\item{Firstly observe that, for ${ z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i, \, z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i }$ we have,
					\[\begin{aligned}
						z_1 z_2 &= (a_1 + b_1 i)(a_2 + b_2 i) \\

					Then,
					\[\begin{aligned}
						\modulus{z_1 z_2} &= [(a_1 a_2 - b_1 b_2)^2 + (a_1 b_2 + a_2 b_1)^2]^{\frac{1}{2}} \\

				\item{Let ${ z_1 = a_1 + b_1 i, \, z_2 = a_2 + b_2 i }$. Then,

					By \autoref{prop:for-any-two-numbers-the-sum-of-squares-minus-twice-product-is-the-square-of-the-difference}, for any numbers ${ p = a_1 b_2, q = b_1 a_2 }$,
